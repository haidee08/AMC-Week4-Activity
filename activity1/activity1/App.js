         Song by
Jaheim, Nelly

I used to pride myself on being the other man
But now it's flipped and I don't want you with no other man
Why can't you understand anything I'm offering
I gave you the world but you just wanted arguin
From the time I picked you up
Until the time I dropped you off again
Even flipped out on me at the mall again
It's his fault again' is what you telling all ya friends
I ain't pointing fingers ma, I just wanna call again
See how ya' doing, I know they stressin on ya
I know them times going hard, thats why I'm checkin on ya'
It's yours truly ma, I got a little message for ya'
Anything he can do, girl, I can do it better for ya', 'cause

When we laugh or we cry it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon' still be as one, it's forever
It's forever

Won't you come on and go with me ooh girl,
Come on over to my place
Won't you sit ya self down and take a sit
And let me ease ya' mind girl
We gon' do it our way

I heard your friend told a friend that told a friend of mine
That you was thinking that we should do it one more time
If this ain't the truth, then hopefully it's not a lie
'Cause I ain't got no issue's with hitting another time
We never had a problem getting it done
Disagreed upon a lot ma, but the sex wasn't one
Now check it, I know you get excited (still)
When I come round and bite (girl)
Quit frowin' up and quit actin' like you don't like

I like it, I like it, I really really like it,
I want it, adore it, so come let me enjoy it

When we laugh or we cry it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon' still be as one it's forever,
It's forever

Won't you come on and go with me ooh girl
Come on over to my place
Won't you sit ya' self down and take a seat
And let me ease ya' mind girl
We gon' do it our way

Shawty where you been
Feels like a long time, long, long-time since I seen ya
Yes it has girl,
When I know I said some fucked up things to you before
But girl you know I didn't mean it
(I didn't mean one single word,)
(I never meant one single word)
If I could take back every word, I would and more for sho'
If I thougt that you believe it
'Cause you make my life so convienent for me

When we laugh or we cry, it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon' still be as one, it's forever
It's forever

Won't you come on and go with me ooh girl
Come on over to my place
Won't you sit ya self down and take a seat
And let me ease ya mind girl
We gon' do it our way

I like it, I like it, I really really like it,
I want it, adore it, so come let me enjoy it

When we laugh or we cry, it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon' still be as one, it's forever
It's forever
